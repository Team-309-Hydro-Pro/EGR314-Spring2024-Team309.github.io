### Final Components Summary Table
|Component| |Selection Rational
|----------|----------|----------|
|Humidity Sensor: HIH6030-021-001|![image](https://github.com/Team-309-Weather-Station/EGR314-Spring2024-Team309.github.io/assets/157083379/f24cfb36-72c6-4fa4-8e4c-9128501e0bad)| -High accuracy, wide operating range, compact design, and robust construction.|
|Temperature Sensor: TC74A4-3.3VCTTR|![image](https://github.com/Team-309-Weather-Station/EGR314-Spring2024-Team309.github.io/assets/157083379/30224660-a336-4b5d-ab6f-39bdf9f647af)| - Low cost, ease of integration via the I2C interface, affordable and compact size.|
|Motor: COM3700|![image](https://github.com/Team-309-Weather-Station/EGR314-Spring2024-Team309.github.io/assets/157083379/b735978e-1274-4216-ba37-75f864b788ba)| - Compact size, sufficient power for effective vapor dispersion, quiet operation, energy efficiency, availability, and cost-effectiveness.|
|Motor Driver: IFX9201SGAUMA1|![P-PG-DSO-12](https://github.com/Team-309-Weather-Station/EGR314-Spring2024-Team309.github.io/assets/157051756/84ac50de-2263-4a08-88df-7c9a837b23b7)| - Large enough to solder by hand without damaging the component. Handles a much higher voltage and current than our product will use, lowering the risk of overloading.|
|3.3V Voltage Regulator: LM2575-3.3WU-TR|![Regulator1_image](https://github.com/Team-309-Weather-Station/EGR314-Spring2024-Team309.github.io/assets/157083379/5796ab92-032a-41f8-90e5-50b22ac70bee)| - Efficiency, reliability, and ability to provide a stable 3.3-volt output.|
|5V Voltage Regulator: LM2576SX-5.0/NOPB|![TS5B](https://github.com/Team-309-Hydro-Pro/EGR314-Spring2024-Team309.github.io/assets/84349229/3d84b38f-868f-42b9-990a-46b6ff450d7a)| - Stable 5V output and ease of implementation required for the motor. Since this driver had to be compatible between the selected motor and the driver a capable and well ranged.|
|Power Supply: A1604 BK210J| ![Battery](https://github.com/Team-309-Weather-Station/EGR314-Spring2024-Team309.github.io/assets/157083379/92e356b3-3811-432b-a5c3-394f82a8db0c)| - Less expensive, acceptable current requirements.|
