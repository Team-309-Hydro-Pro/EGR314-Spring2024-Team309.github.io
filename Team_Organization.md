# **Team Organization**

## Team Goal 

Our team is committed to crafting a robust and practical prototype that not only meets but exceeds the expectations of our projected clients. We understand the importance of adaptability in the face of failures or unforeseen challenges during development, using each setback as an opportunity to learn and improve. Effective communication within our group ensures that all ideas are considered and respectfully discussed, accommodating everyone's interests to the best of our ability. Engaging with stakeholders throughout the engineering process provides invaluable insight, allowing us to tailor our approach to meet their needs precisely. Our ultimate goal is to deliver a final product punctually, ready to showcase on our portfolio and resumes, ensuring it stands as a testament to our dedication to creating devices that endure for years to come.

## Communication Channels

The primary communication channels utilized by our team include ASU email and Discord. Besides, Message would be used as a last method. Details regarding our contact information, roles within the team, and meeting schedule can be found in the appendix. [Appendix A](Appendix_A.md)

## Communication Procedures
Our team has decided to use Discord as our primary form of communication. This allows us to communicate in real time, while also leaving messages readable afterwards. When it comes to the second option, the team has decided to utilize asu email, which is the most classical method to communicate with the team members. Finally, the team made a third choice with Message in case of lack of internet connection.
Any group communication with a situation involving an instructor or a 3rd party will be the meeting leaderâ€™s (Ruryck Adame Butanda) responsibility to address while still involving the team. (e.i. CC the team on emails regarding the situation).
