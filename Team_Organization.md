# **Team Organization**

## Team Goal 

Our team is committed to crafting a robust and practical prototype that not only meets but exceeds the expectations of our projected clients. We understand the importance of adaptability in the face of failures or unforeseen challenges during development, using each setback as an opportunity to learn and improve. Effective communication within our group ensures that all ideas are considered and respectfully discussed, accommodating everyone's interests to the best of our ability. Engaging with stakeholders throughout the engineering process provides invaluable insight, allowing us to tailor our approach to meet their needs precisely. Our ultimate goal is to deliver a final product punctually, ready to showcase on our portfolio and resumes, ensuring it stands as a testament to our dedication to creating devices that endure for years to come.

## Mission Statement 
Our expertise lies in the development of precise and user-friendly air-based environmental instruments specifically designed for mobile users. We prioritize pragmatic considerations and implement robust designs to ensure optimal functionality and reliability. By combining our commitment to accuracy with intuitive usability, we aim to deliver instruments that seamlessly meet the needs of dynamic environmental monitoring on the go.

## Communication Channels

The primary communication channels utilized by our team include ASU email and Discord. Besides, Message would be used as a last method. Details regarding our contact information, roles within the team, and meeting schedule can be found in the appendix. [Appendix A](Appendix_A.md)

## Communication Procedures
The team will primarily use Discord for ongoing discussions and employ in-person meetings, Snapchat Group messages, and weekly meetings for synchronous communication. Urgent matters will be addressed through phone calls. Responsibility for relaying announcements from classes falls on attendees, who will use Snapchat for those unable to attend. Team members will maintain direct contact with the professor, and the team recorder will serve as the main liaison for effective communication. This streamlined strategy aims to enhance collaboration and efficiency throughout the project.
