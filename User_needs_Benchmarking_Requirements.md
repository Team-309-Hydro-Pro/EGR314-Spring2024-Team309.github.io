## Organize, consolidate, and group needs statements

### Process of brainstorming
During our brainstorming sessions, we used both mind mapping and Jamboard to gather and record all the user needs for our weather station project. We began by creating a mind map to explore different aspects of the project and generate ideas. Then, as ideas flowed, we transferred them onto the Jamboard, which allowed us to collaborate in real-time and visually organize our thoughts. Each team member contributed their insights, and together, we evaluated the importance of each user need. By combining mind mapping with Jamboard, we ensured that we thoroughly explored all possibilities and captured every important aspect of the project. This approach helped us create a comprehensive list of user needs, which became the foundation for our design and development process. 

### Grouping needs

In planning our weather station, we grouped the things users wanted into different categories. One category focused on making the station easy to move around, like putting it in a car or using it while hiking. Another category was about the information the station collects, making sure it's accurate and can be used for different purposes. We also looked at how the station is built, making sure it's stable and resistant to things like dust and bad weather. Lastly, we thought about why people would use the station and made sure it meets their needs, like being educational or affordable. These groups helped us understand what users want and guided how we designed our weather station to meet those needs. More details to [Appendix B](Appendix_B.md)


### Ranking needs

To rank the needs for our weather station project, we first gathered all the things users wanted. Then, we had a meeting with our team to talk about each need. We discussed which ones were most important based on how they would affect users and how hard they were to do. We also asked other people for their opinions to make sure we didn't miss anything. We used a system to give each need a score to show how important it was. This helped us focus on the most important things first, making sure we met the most critical requirements for our project to succeed. More details to [Appendix B](Appendix_B.md)

## Product Requirements Document



## Introduction

With limitations of options in mobile weather stations, customer demands for a product with a different take are increasingly noticeable. Mobile weather stations are, reasonably, marketed towards professionals which limit more functions and demands in atmospheric and weather monitoring. Introduction of another product with a wider audience in mind may spread more attention to demands in the field of environmental data collection. 


## Objectives

The project plans to involve the development of a weather station for these demands to a wider public. With the inclusion of 2 sensors for a mobile weather station, the product is intended to collect and transfer data over WiFi using the MQTT protocol. The project also intends to include at least 1 actuator in the form of a motor and communicate commands over a I2C or SPI-based protocol. Functionality of the motor controlled actuator will remain of high importance in this project for successful sensor readings. We aim to maintain similar accuracy to competitors in the weather sensing market which includes the durability they are known for as well.

## Stakeholders

**Target group**: People who necessarily require the humidity control for their skin care/health condition.

**Target purchaser**: It would be those who value indoor comfort, health, and well-being and are willing to invest in products that offer reliable performance and user-friendly features (i.g. Office managers, parents, Wellness Enthusiasts.)

**Customer service**: It would be a durable and simple interface as well as user friendly and compact design. 

**Marketing**: Humidifier featuring sensors for controlling the room humidity condition for personal benefit.

## User Cases

#### User Story #1: Mark (Mobile Weather Station)

Mark is a 45 year old farmer a few hours from the city of Phoenix. Storms and especially in the monsoon season are aspects in weather he needs to be immediately aware of for the optimal care of his crops and ease of his work. Some information may get to him later than others due to his distance. The new weather station our team develops allows for immediate access to environmental data to his current surroundings rather than approximations.

#### User Story #2: Sarah (Smart Humidifier)

Sarah, a 35-year-old architect in Denver, faces dry climate challenges in her home office. Living a bit away from the city center, she lacks immediate weather updates. Our team's smart humidifier provides real-time, location-specific humidity data, helping her maintain comfort and focus without relying on generalized forecasts.


#### User Story #3: Jake (Mobile Weather Station)


Introducing Jake, a 45-year-old farmer situated just outside Phoenix. For Jake, swift access to precise weather data is essential, especially during the monsoon season, to effectively manage his crops and workload. Our team's innovative weather station ensures Jake receives real-time updates tailored to his location, enabling him to make informed decisions promptly for optimal farm care and productivity.

·   	Will it be possible to switch sensors for more user applications?
  - There is a possibilty to implement a switch system but with the final design it is more beneficial to use multiple sensors at the same time for the most accurate monitoring.

·   	How would the team be able to make the product durable?

·     If there is some terrible weather like storms, dangerously hot or cold, what would happen to the product?

·     How could artificial intelligence be applied in the project?

·     Can the product benefit from satellite networks like Starlink?

·     Will the product only be useful indoors?
