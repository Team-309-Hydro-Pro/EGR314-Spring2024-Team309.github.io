## Organize, consolidate, and group needs statements

### Process of brainstorming
During our brainstorming sessions, we used both mind mapping and Jamboard to gather and record all the user needs for our weather station project. We began by creating a mind map to explore different aspects of the project and generate ideas. Then, as ideas flowed, we transferred them onto the Jamboard, which allowed us to collaborate in real-time and visually organize our thoughts. Each team member contributed their insights, and together, we evaluated the importance of each user need. By combining mind mapping with Jamboard, we ensured that we thoroughly explored all possibilities and captured every important aspect of the project. This approach helped us create a comprehensive list of user needs, which became the foundation for our design and development process. 

### Grouping needs

In planning our weather station, we grouped the things users wanted into different categories. One category focused on making the station easy to move around, like putting it in a car or using it while hiking. Another category was about the information the station collects, making sure it's accurate and can be used for different purposes. We also looked at how the station is built, making sure it's stable and resistant to things like dust and bad weather. Lastly, we thought about why people would use the station and made sure it meets their needs, like being educational or affordable. These groups helped us understand what users want and guided how we designed our weather station to meet those needs. More details to [Appendix B](Appendix_B.md)


### Ranking needs

To rank the needs for our weather station project, we first gathered all the things users wanted. Then, we had a meeting with our team to talk about each need. We discussed which ones were most important based on how they would affect users and how hard they were to do. We also asked other people for their opinions to make sure we didn't miss anything. We used a system to give each need a score to show how important it was. This helped us focus on the most important things first, making sure we met the most critical requirements for our project to succeed. More details to [Appendix B](Appendix_B.md)
