# **Most Important Things Learned**

1. In regards to the cadence PCB design and limitations we learned nearly a completely new way to design a PCB with with the CADENCE software. With the focus on the solder mount design, we are allowed to integrate even more complex designs with the limitations of even smaller components. Everything from via and trace sizing to the limitations in differenc PCB layers, it became apparent that meticulous planning as early as possible leads to the best chances at success.
   
2. With MQTT connections, we were able to to learn a lot from server connections via esp32 instead of being limited to hardcoded microcontroller functions. Though software, such as the MQTT explorer had limitations in it of itself mainly from the lack of user manipulation and the thonny integration into the ESP32 device. We learned to transfer data these sections successfully which allows for a much better understanding of wireless data transfer with this relatively simple design.
    
 
3.  Though interrupt code integration was at times uncooperative with the main code and difficult to manage, understanding the importance of implementing such a function for these loop based systems. Ultimately we were successful in implementing a interrupt which allowed a more organized loop escape avoiding any loop sequence from getting stuck.
  
4. Soldering and physical pin planning were aspects that were familiarized from before but greately expanded with this project. By taking into account even the different soldering methods such as hot plate reflowing or baking, we were exposed to more mistakes we could do in soldering the already meticulous board. With these mistakes we learned how to use solder paste how to design a PCB so certain smaller compenents are more accessible for hand soldering.

5. I2C and SPI connections were data transfer methods we weren't all familiar with quite yet. As we learned to apply the I2C connection to components such as the sensors and differ them to SPI, we learned to be able to work around the differences in these data transfers on the same microcontroller. From the addresses that the I2C rails use to differ the origins of the data to the functions of the SPI in the motor controller's gate-like regulation on the motor, we practiced the cooperative iintegration of these different methods of communication control.

6. Component selections and their datasheet limitations were also a valuable lesson on planning and mindfulness. As selecting the best materials for a non-existant product while keeping their compatability is difficult but now very evident to keep in mind. Since doing appropriate research is already a staple in planning, knowing how to read and what to look for in a data sheet. Frotheir m voltage input and output ranges to temperature ratings and signal I2C 

7. Power source applications and limitations


8. Signal filtering and optimization


9. Hardware component ordering and sizing (ordering promptly)


10. Project updating and team communication (github)
