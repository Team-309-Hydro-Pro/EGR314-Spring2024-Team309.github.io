Recommendations For Future Students
## 1. Don't be afraid to ask for help.
This is not an easy class. You won't understand everything right away, and you won't do everything right on your first try. You will make mistakes, and many of them will probably be stupid mistakes. It's better to ask for help and realize you forgot something basic than to not ask for help and have no idea what went wrong.

## 2. Make no assumptions. Test everything thoroughly.
Just because part of your device works on its own, doesn't mean it will work when connected to another part. You will be working with some complex and sensitive components which may interact with each other in unexpected ways. Test thoroughly and test often, so you don't have to take apart your entire device to diagnose a problem.

## 3. Everything will take longer than you think.
Give yourself at least twice as much time as you think you need for everything. Almost everything in this class is more complicated than it initially seems, and will take more time than you think it will. Start every assignment as soon as you can, even if it isn't due for weeks. As mentioned above, you will make mistakes and you will need help with things, so give yourself time to deal with that. Also, giving yourself more time makes it easier to deal with unexpected issues, like computer crashes or damaged components.

## 4. Familiarize yourself with Cadence and circuit design.
You will be designing several Printed Circuit Boards using Cadence in this class. Cadence is a powerful tool, but it isn't very "user-friendly," especially for beginners. There are tutorials available online, but many things change from version to version. Make sure the tutorials you use are for the correct version of Cadence.

## 5. Redundancy is important.
As mentioned above, you will make mistakes and you will have unforseen problems. Designing redundancies into your device will make things much easier. Add extra headers onto you PCB in case you need to reroute a trace. Order more of every component than you think you need in case you break or lose some. Even if you don't use them, it's better to have them than to need them and not have them.
