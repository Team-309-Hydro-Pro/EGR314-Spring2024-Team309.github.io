## Introduction

This is the team for EGR 314 Spring 2024. In the quest for better home comfort, accuracy and simplicity are key. While professional weather stations have highly precise sensors for weather forecasting, there's a chance to bring similar accuracy and ease to everyday home devices. While mobile apps help us understand outdoor weather, they really only tell us the conditions outside the weather station, which can differ wildly from our indoor environments. The use of air conditioners or even simple things like window shutters can drastically affect the conditions inside our homes. One such example are humidifiers which are often used to combat the effects of living in a dry climate, but can make the environment uncomfortably humid if overused. However, humidifiers can be equipped with advanced sensors to accurately measure humidity and temperature, making indoor living more comfortable, accurate and healthy. This isn't just an idea; it's our goal where advanced sensor technology meets user-friendly design. We offer a new way to manage home climate through HydroPro. Team 309 aims to design an automatic weather-detecting humidifier. HydroPro is the humidifier that controls the desired humidity in the air as it constantly measures the current humidity in a room's enviornment. 

The project plans to integrate the detection power of a weather station with simplicity of use for better accessibility to a wider public. With built-in humidity and temperature sensors, the product collects and transfers environmental data over WiFi using the MQTT protocol, where it can be easily accessed by the user. The project also uses a water pump to humidify and cool the surrounding air. Unlike other humidifers, HydroPro uses the data it collects to automatically activate and deactivate the pump via SPI-based protocol, keeping the environmental conditions perfectly within the user's preferences. Therefore, we aim to maintain similar accuracy and durability to competitors in the weather sensing market. 

Our main intended user base is individuals who require specific humidity control for comfort or health. Whether it be for natural skin care necessities or more serious health conditions, we believe that higher precision in data collection can lead to high quality humidity control to benefit everyone. Anyone that values indoor comfort, health, and well-being is our target demographic. Whether they are office managers, parents, wellness enthusiasts, people with specific health needs, or simply prefer a more comfortable environment, we aim to offer the same attention to quality in our product through the implementations of a durable, a simple to use, and compact design. Ultimately, marketing the design is to be done by highlighting the humidifier, specifically the sensors for controlling the room humidity for personal benefit.
