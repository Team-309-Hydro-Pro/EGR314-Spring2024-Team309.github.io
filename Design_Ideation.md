# Design Ideation

### Generated Ideas

#### The Process
The process of generating ideas consisted of an in-person meeting with all of the group members. We created a group Jam Board where each sticky note denotes one idea. This needed to be done in person to ensure that generated ideas were not duplicated throughout the brainstorming process. Each team member added to this brainstorming session individually for the first 50-60 features until our team became stuck. We then reconvened as a team to further extrapolate from these ideas to find overarching themes that held great significance to our project. During the more collaborative portion of this project, our team fostered a welcoming space for all ideas both far-reaching and earthbound. After generating 100 individual ideas we were able to rank these into 3 different color-coded categories listed below.

* ðŸŸ© Embedded Systems: Anything related to the PCB (Sockets, EMF, Fuse Overcharge, Sensors)
* ðŸŸ¦ Hardware: Physical components to support the PCB (Wheels, 3D print items, Frames) 
* ðŸŸ§ Software: Anything that will be digital to support the PCB (AI, Voice Recognition, Code)

### Concepts
#### **Concept 1 - Rotating Weather Station**

##### **Description**: This design concept is a mobile hand held set of sensors that can be placed without installation for light weather monitoring. It detects the wind speed and direction on the top, as well as the humidity at the bottom. The mobility in this concept was focused on the ability to carry it around from a location without the need of securing onto a surface. Since the device would be carried by hand power through the use of a battery would be reasonable to implement here since recharging it on the go or before use would be easy for users. 


#### **Concept 2 - Rooftop Weather Station**

##### **Description**: This device can be installed on the roof of a home or other building. The device is designed to be easy to install, or to move to another location. To achieve this, the design will be small and light, and will not require complex installation. The device detects the wind speed and direction, as well as the ambient temperature. The device uses a pinwheel fan to detect wind speed, and finds the wind direction by rotating until it finds the highest wind speed. The device will also have a temperature sensor. The purpose of this device is to give users a more accurate description of the weather, because weather apps and official weather reports use readings from stations that may be far away from the user, resulting in inaccurate reports.

#### **Concept 3 - Automatic Water sprayer**

##### **Description**: This concept is a water dispenser that waters surroundings that are dependent on optimal atmospheric conditions, temperature and humidity. This concept measures the temperature and humidity and once the temperature is too high or it is dry in the air, the mixture is dispersed. This concept also uses a focus on mobility since this is considered to be used on a larger land of planting or growing. With the possible use of a planting on the ground, the device can be placed on different parts of the dirt for a larger coverage. This would require a power source just as mobile. Since it is meant to be outside a solar system alongside a battery seems optimal. Since we intend to cover a larger range connectivity between multiple devices is also considered to be appropriate for this concept.
