# Design Ideation

### Generated Ideas

#### The Process of brainstorming
In the brainstorming session when it comes to gathering ideas, Jin and Andrew were providing the fundemental design concepts. Then, the team assembled in Discord and started to write down the ideas that they were coming up with into the board. Aaron and Ruryck were amplifing the ideas and make them specified. During the brainstorming session, the team was using mindmap as well as Jamboard. When it comes to effective methoed to brainstorm within such circumstance, the team believe that collecting each individual's idea was effective since it made the team easier to group and rank right away. On the other hand, there was a quesiton whether mindmapping is a efficient idea gathering method or not because since the team was coming up with each other idea there was of no use to draw mindmap and even though we did, it was organizing the ideas into catergories, which was a grouping at most. Thus, after organizing and grouping ideas with mindmap, the team was prioritizng the ideas. In terms of those initial concepts, the team was focused on ranking the ideas in order of the level how was the idea related to the three concepts. After that, the team decided to group the related ideas into three design concepts. Creation of the three concepts was taken part of Jin. More details to [Appendix C](Appendix_C.md)

### Concepts
#### **Concept 1 - Rotating Weather Station**

##### **Description**: 
  This is the first design concept, which is a rotating weather station. It has a plastic plate that casing the wires and PCB into it. Under the plate, the motor is located in the middle of the plate so that it would be able to rotate the plate. The key point of this concept is this product would be detecting Wind speed and temperature in different spots every other 10 minutes. Every 10 minutes, the motor rotates the plate and the sensors would be moved to the other spot. As a result, the sensors would be detecting the wind speed and temperature with each different spot in the air and get more accurate information about weather.


#### **Concept 2 - Rooftop Weather Station**

##### **Description**: 
  This device can be installed on the roof of a home or other building. The device is designed to be easy to install, or to move to another location. To achieve this, the design will be small and light, and will not require complex installation. The device detects the wind speed and direction, as well as the ambient humidity. The device uses a pinwheel fan to detect wind speed, and finds the wind direction by rotating until it finds the highest wind speed. The device will also have a humidity sensor. The purpose of this device is to give users a more accurate description of the weather, because weather apps and official weather reports use readings from stations that may be far away from the user, resulting in inaccurate reports.

#### **Concept 3 - Automatic Water sprayer**

##### **Description**: 
  This concept is a water dispenser that waters surroundings that are dependent on optimal atmospheric conditions, temperature and humidity. This concept measures the temperature and humidity and once the temperature is too high or it is dry in the air, the mixture is dispersed. This concept also uses a focus on mobility since this is considered to be used on a larger land of planting or growing. With the possible use of a planting on the ground, the device can be placed on different parts of the dirt for a larger coverage. This would require a power source just as mobile. Since it is meant to be outside a solar system alongside a battery seems optimal. Since we intend to cover a larger range connectivity between multiple devices is also considered to be appropriate for this concept.
