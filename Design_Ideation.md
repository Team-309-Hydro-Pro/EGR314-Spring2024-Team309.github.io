# Design Ideation

### Generated Ideas

#### The Process
The process of generating ideas consisted of an in-person meeting with all of the group members. We created a group Jam Board where each sticky note denotes one idea. This needed to be done in person to ensure that generated ideas were not duplicated throughout the brainstorming process. Each team member added to this brainstorming session individually for the first 50-60 features until our team became stuck. We then reconvened as a team to further extrapolate from these ideas to find overarching themes that held great significance to our project. During the more collaborative portion of this project, our team fostered a welcoming space for all ideas both far-reaching and earthbound. After generating 100 individual ideas we were able to rank these into 3 different color-coded categories listed below.

* ðŸŸ© Embedded Systems: Anything related to the PCB (Sockets, EMF, Fuse Overcharge, Sensors)
* ðŸŸ¦ Hardware: Physical components to support the PCB (Wheels, 3D print items, Frames) 
* ðŸŸ§ Software: Anything that will be digital to support the PCB (AI, Voice Recognition, Code)

### Concepts
#### Concept 1
![Concept1](https://github.com/EGR314-Spring2024-Team303/EGR314-Spring2024-Team303.github.io/assets/39510849/88a70d1b-fcb9-4aa8-82bf-23aee8d07889)
##### Description:
The first design concept sketch is a rough idea of a mobile weather station. This design was inspired by the Jaguar 4x4 on Dr. Robot's website. This design will enable the mobile weather station to drive while flipped upside down to ensure maximum mobility and long-distance recognizance by the rover. The large wheels create a large ground clearance that is optimal in most environments. This design's main focus is the mobility and ability to recover itself in most situations.
#### Concept 2

##### Description: 
The second sketch represents a 2-wheeler RC with a PCB socket and other components integrated into it like headlights and sensors. The drive system will utilize one motor and the steering will come from a differential in the speed of the two wheels. This design was inspired by Wall-E. This is a preferable design because the design will be compact and will feature a lightweight design. 
#### Concept 3
![Concept3](https://github.com/EGR314-Spring2024-Team303/EGR314-Spring2024-Team303.github.io/assets/39510849/46b365b9-fa93-49db-ab1e-e9d680756157)
##### Description:
This is an RC Truck Design that has an open-air PCB for its wind sensor and accurate temperature gauge. The battery will be housed in the "cab" portion of the truck. This will ensure that the battery doesn't cause thermal interference and will be safe for harsh conditions. This is an integral feature, as the battery integrity will be called into question in inhospitable climates. The High wheel clearance and suspension will make this design easy to maneuver over large obstacles without getting stuck. This four-wheel design will also feature a differential and traction control. All of this can be accomplished with the truck Cab design with it being able to hold large batteries for extended periods.
