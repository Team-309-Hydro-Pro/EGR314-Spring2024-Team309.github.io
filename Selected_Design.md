The final ideas the team had left for the Design Ideation of the project left members disinterested in functions and applicability to the real world. The required motor application seemed uninteresting as well as unnecessary. Applications of the project ideas also seemed overdone, repetitive and difficult to justify when justifying more specific types of users. Most of the initial ideas included incorporating a motor that could work without the application of a motor. This approach wasnâ€™t a comfortable use of materials and project opportunity. Devices that would rest on surfaces just to read temperatures resulted in a possibly unidentifiable user base. With these concerns in mind, we looked inward to our personal devices and simply became interested in humidifiers. With the exception of expensive products, most humidifiers lacked user-programmable aspects that aligned with this project as well.

Ultimately the design evolved into a simplified humidifier that cycles water up a spout to drop and evaporate, which adds water to the air when necessary thus creating a natural humidifier. The design in composed of mainly 2  components. A compartment for the circuit board and a compartment for the water reservoir. Ultimately this design was selected to accommodate for the size of the PCB board and the necessary water requiired to submerge and fit the motor pump for the best results. The design only slightly deviates from the original humidifier design due to accommodations to the 3D printing restriction at the time. Overall the intended natural waterfall humidifer design did coincide with our expectations of its functions and data related behavior.
