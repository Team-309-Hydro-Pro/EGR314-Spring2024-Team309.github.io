The final ideas the team had left for the Design Ideation of the project left members disinterested in functions and applicability to the real world. The required motor application seemed uninteresting as well as unnecessary. Applications of the project ideas also seemed overdone, repetitive and difficult to justify when justifying more specific types of users. Most of the initial ideas included incorporating a motor that could work without the application of a motor. This approach wasnâ€™t a comfortable use of materials and project opportunity. Devices that would rest on surfaces just to read temperatures resulted in a possibly unidentifiable user base. With these concerns in mind, we looked inward to our personal devices and simply became interested in humidifiers. With the exception of expensive products, most humidifiers lacked user-programmable aspects that aligned with this project as well.
