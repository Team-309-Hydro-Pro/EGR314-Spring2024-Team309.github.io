The final ideas the team had left for the Design Ideation of the project left members disinterested in functions and applicability to the real world. The required motor application seemed uninteresting as well as unnecessary. Applications of the project ideas also seemed overdone, repetitive and difficult to justify when justifying more specific types of users. Most of the initial ideas included incorporating a motor that could work without the application of a motor. This approach wasnâ€™t a comfortable use of materials and project opportunity. So, the final design concept was aimed at the humidifier that controls the humidity in the air according to the temperature and humidity as the sensors constantly measure the values.

Ultimately the design evolved into a simplified humidifier that cycles water up a spout to drop and evaporate, which adds water to the air when necessary thus creating a natural humidifier. The design in composed of mainly 2  components. A compartment for the circuit board and a compartment for the water reservoir. To be specific, the design was focused on seperating the electric components from water storage because of the potential issue that might happen. Ultimately this design was selected to accommodate for the size of the PCB board and the necessary water required to submerge and fit the motor pump for the best results. The design only slightly deviates from the original humidifier design due to accommodations to the 3D printing restriction at the time. Overall the intended natural waterfall humidifer design did coincide with our expectations of its functions and data related behavior.
